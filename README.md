This collection includes different types of sensors for different purposes
- emulated sensors and real sensors
- sensors using Things-specific APIs to monitor Things
- sensors using Software-defined Gateways API to monitor Things
- sensors using different cloud connectivity types to send data to Cloud/Gateways
- sensors running in different environments (bare OS, docker, vagrant, etc.)
- sensors running in a single node (emulated or real)
