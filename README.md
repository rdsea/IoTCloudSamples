# IoT Cloud Samples
This collection includes different types of IoT units, samples of IoT Cloud Systems, data, and testing scenarios for different purposes
## Sensors
- emulated sensors and real sensors
- sensors using Things-specific APIs to monitor Things
- sensors using Software-defined Gateways API to monitor Things
- sensors using different cloud connectivity types to send data to Cloud/Gateways
- sensors running in different environments (bare OS, docker, vagrant, etc.)
- sensors running in a single node (emulated or real)
- sensors running within a topology (creating a network of sensors)
## IoT Cloud example
- BTS monitoring
## Data
- real data from monitoring real BTS
## Testing Scenarios
- for testing uncertainty
- for testing incidents
