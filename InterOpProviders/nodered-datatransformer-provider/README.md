# Introduction

This is a service for data transformation based on node-red. The idea is that the provider offers "node-red service" as a resource. One consumer can request a resource then submit workflows to the resource to perform data transformation. Therefore during runtime, such resources can be used for interoperability.

Supported by the [Inter-IoT project](http://www.inter-iot-project.eu/).

## Configuration

### Kubernetes requirements and setup

We have tested with Google Cloud Platform Kubernetes and Minikube/Kubernetes  in a single server. Note the following settings:

* all kube* commandlines should be in the execution path of the service
* $export MINIKUBE_NODEPORT=True for minikube without loadbalancer: in this case an external ip cannot be exposed, we will use nodeport for exposing service information. In this case the command "minikube" must be in the execution path.

### Node-red container

The service will use a default node-red container. However, this can be replaced by a customized one:

The default node-red container is "nodered/node-red-docker", specified in the configTemplates/deployTemplate.js:

```
"containers": [
  {
    "name": "nodereddatatranformer",
    "image": "nodered/node-red-docker",'
```

this is the default image that can be downloaded from [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nodered/node-red/) and made available to Kubernetes.

To use the service with a customized node-red container image:

* Change the image name suitable to the customized node-red image
* Make sure that Kubernetes can access the container image. See the [guideline here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/)
* If you use minikube: just download the container image and add it into the server running minikube

### Configure MongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) is used to store information about resources. The URL of MongoDB must be set through environment variable, such as

```
$export MONGODB_URL=
```

Alternatively, the configuration can also be loaded from **.env** file, e.g., using the dotenv/config pre-loading

```
$node --require dotenv/config

```
>Note: [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) offers some free instances that can be used to test.

### Running services

`npm start`

### Examples

#### Check if the service is available:
```
$curl -X GET http://[hostname]:3004/datatransformer
```

#### Create a new data transformer without information about tenant:
```
$curl -X POST http://[hostname]:3004/datatransformer
```

#### Create a new data transformer with information about tenant:

You can also specify tenant information (tenantId, name, description) using
```
$curl -X POST http://[hostname]:3004/datatransformer
```

with the body of {tenantId:[id],description:[description], name:[name]} where tenantId, description, and name are provided by the creator.

for example:
```
$curl --header "Content-Type: application/json"   --request POST  --data '{ "tenantId": "valenciaportcontrol", "description": "this is a special instance for valencia port", "name":"truckprocessor"}' http://localhost:3004/datatransformer
```
would return an instance:
```
{"_id":"5b4fdcbdb03bd3e52f058a68","tenantId":"valenciaportcontrol","description":"this is a special instance for valencia port","name":"truckprocessor","location":"creating...","createdAt":1531960508701,"datatransformerId":"datatransformer1531960508701","port":1880,"url":"pending...","__v":0}truong@daredevil:~$
```

#### List existing transformer resources:
```
$curl -X GET http://[hostname]:3004/datatransformer/list
```

#### Get detailed information about a transformer
For example, with the id =datatransformer1528623333334:

```
$curl -X GET http://daredevil:3004/datatransformer/datatransformer1528623333334
```

#### Remove a transformer

for example, with the id = datatransformer1528623333334

```
$curl -X DELETE http://daredevil:3004/datatransformer/datatransformer1528623333334
```
